#  CGPA CALCULATOR
------Objective ---
For college students keeping track of their cgpa is pretty important so that they can keep a balance 
between their academics and co curricular acivities along with good marks thus its much difficult to 
keep on calculating again and again the tgpas and cgpa and hence this CGPA calculator helps to 
instantly calculate the tgpa and cgpa of a student based on certain inputs. 
We have created a very user friendly graphical user interface so that user can easily run through it 
without any difficulty. 
The project also stores all the data in a database for permanent storage. If a user wants to check already 
entered data we have also provided an option for that and he/she can also see the grade points related 
to each grade if they wish to. 
The major purpose of the project is to help students keep track of their grades and markings. Also they 
can predict how much they have to score to keep the desired cgpa for the year. 
Calculation of tgpas and cgpa have become much more easier through this project the student are 
easily able to know the grading system.
