# CGPA_CALCULATOR
Design a CGPA calculator with the GUI and showing the grades based on the GPA using python 

------Objective ---
For college students keeping track of their cgpa is pretty important so that they can keep a balance 
between their academics and co curricular acivities along with good marks thus its much difficult to 
keep on calculating again and again the tgpas and cgpa and hence this CGPA calculator helps to 
instantly calculate the tgpa and cgpa of a student based on certain inputs. 
We have created a very user friendly graphical user interface so that user can easily run through it 
without any difficulty. 
The project also stores all the data in a database for permanent storage. If a user wants to check already 
entered data we have also provided an option for that and he/she can also see the grade points related 
to each grade if they wish to. 
The major purpose of the project is to help students keep track of their grades and markings. Also they 
can predict how much they have to score to keep the desired cgpa for the year. 
Calculation of tgpas and cgpa have become much more easier through this project the student are 
easily able to know the grading system.

USING OF  GUI : 
In this project we have made a GUI interface to calculate CGPA by taking all the details from the 
student like Grades, Credits and subjects for different semesters. In this GUI we have also shown a 
separate area with grading points which will tell user about how points are being assigned to each 
and every grade. This GUI project will help many universities and colleges as it is simple to use and 
its User Interface  is very user friendly. This GUI also has save button that will automatically save 
all the details of student along with all the CGPA in the connected database in the backend. 
One extra button of reset is also there which will clear all the details of the student if in case he/she 
fills wrong data by mistake. One special feature is also there in this GUI is that there is button which 
says ‘Click Me’. After clicking on this button it will automatically load one text box and it will tell 
user about all the grading points .Lastly there is REMARKS field which will show the remarks to 
students like good and very good according to the CGPA which will be calculated in this GUI.  
This whole GUI is made by using Tkinter which is one of the best library of Python for making GUI. 
And it provides each and every single feature of GUI like use of buttons, checkboxes, entry boxes 
and labels. Its all commands are very simple and easy to implement.  
For database we have used SQlite3 which is a very good database technique generally used in 
collaboration with python
